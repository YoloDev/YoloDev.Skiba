This project is base on [SecurityDriven.Inferno](https://github.com/sdrapkin/SecurityDriven.Inferno),
all credit goes to them (except if there is something wrong, then it's probably my fault :P).

I've attemped to make this project usable in DNX (spesifically, it should work on both net45, and
.NET Core).

And just so it's said:
